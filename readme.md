❌ Bad Code:
```javascript
function sum() {return a+b;}
```

🔍 Issues:
*   ❌ The function `sum` attempts to use variables `a` and `b` without them being defined within the function's scope or passed as arguments. This will lead to unexpected behavior or errors, as JavaScript will look for these variables in the outer scope, and if not found, it will resolve to `undefined`.
*   ❌ The function lacks clear input parameters, making it unclear what values it should operate on.

✅ Recommended Fix:

```javascript
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

💡 Improvements:
*   ✔ The function now accepts two arguments, `a` and `b`, which are the values to be summed.
*   ✔ The function explicitly defines the input values, making its purpose and usage clear.
*   ✔ This approach ensures that the function operates on the provided values, avoiding reliance on external variables and potential scope issues.
*   ✔ You can use the function like this: `sum(5, 3);` which will return `8`.
